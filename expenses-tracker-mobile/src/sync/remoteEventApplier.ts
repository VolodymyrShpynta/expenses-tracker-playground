/**
 * Apply remote events to the local store — port of the backend's
 * `RemoteEventProcessor` + `ExpenseSyncProjector` + `ExpenseSyncRecorder`
 * trio, collapsed to a single module since mobile has no Spring proxy
 * pitfall (the backend split was driven by `@Transactional` self-invocation,
 * not by domain concerns).
 *
 * Invariants preserved verbatim from the backend:
 *   - Idempotent: events whose `eventId` is already in `processed_events`
 *     are skipped silently.
 *   - Per-event isolation: a failure on one event logs and continues —
 *     it MUST NOT abort the remaining events. (Implemented as per-chunk
 *     fast path with per-event fallback on chunk failure — see
 *     `batchApply.ts`.)
 *   - Atomic apply: each successful application runs `projection update`
 *     + `processed_events insert` inside a single transaction so a crash
 *     mid-apply leaves the store consistent.
 *   - Conflict semantics:
 *       CREATED, UPDATED → `projectFromEvent` (LWW UPSERT, strict `>` on `updated_at`)
 *       DELETED         → `markAsDeleted(payload.updatedAt)` (only transitions to deleted)
 *
 * Logging never includes payload contents — same PII rule as the backend.
